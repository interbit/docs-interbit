= Configure the Example

This section describes how to configure the example.

== Create a GitHub OAuth application

The Accounts app supports account creation and authentication via GitHub
only. In order to complete an OAuth flow with GitHub as the identity
provider, you need to create a new GitHub OAuth app and configure it to
connect to the `web-auth-endpoint` node.

. Visit link:https://github.com/[github.com] and log into your account.
+

role="frame"]

. Navigate to Settings > Developer Settings > OAuth Apps.
+
image:img/screen-github-oauth_apps.png["The OAuth apps screen on
GitHub", 1280, 303, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-github-register_new_app.png["The Register a new
  application button on GitHub", 207, 34, role="right"]
  Click the **Register a new application** button. The **Register a new
  OAuth application** screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-github-register_oauth.png["The Register a new OAuth
application screen on GitHub", 1280, 623, role="frame"]

. In the **Application name** field, enter a name of your choice. For
  example, `Interbit Test App`.

. In the **Homepage URL** field, enter a URL. Any URL works since we are
  running the example locally.

. In the **Authorization callback URL** field, enter
  `http://localhost:8888/oauth/github`.
+
NOTE: The callback URL is case sensitive, and the port specified is for
running the `web-auth-endpoint` node locally.

. image:img/button-github-register_app.png["The Register app button on
  GitHub", 163, 34, role="right"]
  Click the **Register application** button to finish creating the OAuth
  app.
+
IMPORTANT: Leave this browser tab open as we are going to copy values
from this tab in subsequent steps.


== Clone the `interbit` repository and install `interbit-cli`

. Open a terminal and clone the `interbit` repository from GitHub:
+
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/interbit/interbit.git

. Install the link:/reference/interbit-cli/README.md[`interbit-cli`]
  package globally:
+
[source,bash]
npm i -g interbit-cli


== Generate a set of private and public keys for the `platform-deploy` and `web-auth-endpoint` hypervisors

. Create a `secrets` directory at the root of the `interbit` repository.
+
The `secrets` directory is included in this repository's `.gitignore`
file and is not tracked by git. We don't want to commit the files we are
going to add here because they include private keys for our Interbit
nodes.

. Change the current working directory to the `secrets` directory:
+
[source,bash]
cd secrets

. Generate Interbit key pairs
+
Both the `platform-deploy` and `web-auth-endpoint` apps require public
and private keys. The following commands generate them and store them in
JSON files:
+
[source,bash]
interbit keys --filename platform-deploy-keys.json
interbit keys --filename web-auth-endpoint-keys.json


== Configure environment variables for `platform-deploy`

. Create the file `platform-deploy.sh` in the `secrets` directory with
  the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Secrets for Accounts app GitHub OAuth chain
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=""
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=""
export GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL=""
export OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:3025/account/oauth/gitHub"
# Key pair for the platform node
export PUBLIC_KEY=""
export PRIVATE_KEY=""
# Peer list override
export PORT=5025
export CONNECT_TO_PEERS="localhost:8888"
----

. Update the configuration in `platform-deploy.sh`:
+
--
[loweralpha]
. Copy the `Client ID` value from the GitHub browser tab and paste it
  into the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` definition in `platform-deploy.sh`.

. Copy the `Client Secret` value from the GitHub browser tab and paste
  it into the `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` definition in `platform-deploy.sh`.

. In `Authorization callback URL` definition in `platform-deploy.sh`,
  specify: `http://localhost:8888/oauth/github`.

. Copy the `publicKey` value from `platform-deploy-keys.json` and paste
  it into the `PUBLIC_KEY` definition in `platform-deploy.sh`.

. Copy the `privateKey` value from `platform-deploy-keys.json` and paste
  it into the `PRIVATE_KEY` definition in `platform-deploy.sh`.
--

. Save the updated `platform-deploy.sh` file.


== Configure environment variables for `web-auth-endpoint`

. Create the file `web-auth-endpoint.sh` in the `secrets` directory with
  the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Secrets for Accounts app GitHub OAuth chain
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=""
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=""
# Key pair for the web auth node
export PUBLIC_KEY=""
export PRIVATE_KEY=""
# Peer list override
export PORT=8888
export CONNECT_TO_PEERS="localhost:5025"
----

. Update the configuration in `web-auth-endpoint.sh`:
+
--
[loweralpha]
. Copy the `Client ID` value from the GitHub browser tab and paste it
  into the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` definition in `web-auth-endpoint.sh`.

. Copy the `Client Secret` value from the GitHub browser tab and paste
  it into the `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` definition in
  `web-auth-endpoint.sh`.

. Copy the `publicKey` value from `web-auth-endpoint-keys.json` and paste
  it into the `PUBLIC_KEY` definition in `web-auth-endpoint.sh`.

. Copy the `privateKey` value from `web-auth-endpoint-keys.json` and paste
  it into the `PRIVATE_KEY` definition in `web-auth-endpoint.sh`.
--

. Save the updated `web-auth-endpoint.sh` file.


== Update the configuration file for the Accounts app

. Navigate to the Accounts app directory:
+
[source,bash]
cd ../packages/app-account

. Open the file `interbit.config.js`. The first few lines of this file
  are:
+
[source,js]
----
const path = require('path')
const chainAliases = require('./src/constants/chainAliases')
const { controlActionTypes } = require('./src/constants/actionTypes')

const PUB_KEY = ''
const WEB_AUTH_PUB_KEY = ''

const config = {
    ...
----

. Copy the `publicKey` value from `platform-deploy-keys.json` and paste
  it into the `PUB_KEY` definition in `interbit.config.js`.

. Copy the `publicKey` value from `web-auth-endpoint-keys.json` and
  paste it into the `WEB_AUTH_PUB_KEY` definition in
  `interbit.config.js`.

. Save the updated `interbit.config.js` file.


== Update the configuration file for the Template app

. Navigate to the Template app directory:
+
[source,bash]
cd ../interbit-template

. Open the file `interbit.config.js`. The first few lines of this file
  are:
+
[source,js]
----
const path = require('path')
const chainAliases = require('./src/constants/chainAliases')

const PUBLIC_KEY = ''

const config = {
    ...
----

. Copy the `publicKey` value from `platform-deploy-keys.json` and paste
  it into the `PUBLIC_KEY` definition in `interbit.config.js`.

. Save the updated `interbit.config.js` file.

== Delete the `platform-deploy` manifest file

The manifest file must be deleted when new Interbit key pairs are
generated, as we did in our setup. If there is a pre-existing manifest,
the genesis blocks are not overwritten and our new keys do not work.
Note that when we generate a new manifest, we create new genesis blocks
which results in new chain IDs (which are hashes of the genesis blocks).

[source,bash]
----
cd ../platform-deploy
rm platform/interbit.manifest.json
----


== Configuration complete

At this point, all of the apps are configured. See the
link:run.adoc[next section] to see how to start all four applications.
