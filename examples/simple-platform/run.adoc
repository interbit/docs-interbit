= Run the Example Locally

This section describes how to start the `platform-deploy` and
`web-auth-endpoint` nodes and the Accounts and Template apps.

NOTE: The following procedures assume that you are continuing from
link:configure.adoc[Configure the Example].


== Build and start the `platform-deploy` node

. Open a new terminal and run the following commands from the `interbit`
  repository's root:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm i
source secrets/platform-deploy.sh
cd packages/platform-deploy
npm run build:dev
npm start
----
+
Our package script runs a post-install step which builds all of the
modules in the `interbit` repository. The `build:dev` step for
`platform-deploy` creates a new manifest file using the newly-generated
keys and hashed covenant files. The build step also updates the chain
IDs for the other modules, including `app-account` and
`interbit-template`.
+
The `start` command spins up the `platform-deploy` node, which listens
for incoming connections from the `web-auth-endpoint` node and the
Account and Template apps' browser nodes.
+
IMPORTANT: Leave this terminal open.

. Wait for `platform-deploy` to fully initialize.
+
Once you see the following line, `platform-deploy` is fully initialized
and you can move on to the next step:
+
`ROOT SAGA: watching for app-account-github-kyc/OAUTH_CALLBACK_SAGA`
+
[NOTE]
======
As of mid-August 2018, the `platform-deploy` node can take 2-3 minutes
to create the required blockchains, as it waits to see if any peers are
already hosting the blockchains.
+
This is the only step where a delay is imposed.
======


== Start the `web-auth-endpoint`  node

. Open a new terminal (the second) and run the following commands from
  the `interbit` repository's root:
+
[source,bash]
----
source secrets/web-auth-endpoint.sh
cd packages/web-auth-endpoint
npm start
----
+
IMPORTANT: Leave this terminal open.


== Start the Accounts and Template apps

. Open a new terminal (the third) and run the following commands from
  the `interbit` repository's root:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd packages/app-account
npm start
----
+
IMPORTANT: Leave this terminal open.
+
A new tab opens in your browser at `http://localhost:3025`,
displaying the Accounts app:
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app.png["The Accounts app", 1280, 541,
role="frame"]
+
This React app starts an Interbit node to connect to the
`platform-deploy` and `web-auth-endpoint` peer nodes running in the
first two terminals.

. Open a new terminal (the fourth) and run the following commands from
  the `interbit` repository's root:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd packages/interbit-template
npm start
----
+
IMPORTANT: Leave this terminal open.
+
A new tab opens in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`, displaying
the Template app.
+
image:img/screen-template_app.png["The Template app", 1280, 703,
role="frame"]
+
This React app starts an Interbit node to connect to the
`platform-deploy` peer node.


== Startup complete

Both nodes and both apps are now running. See the
link:operation.adoc[next section] for the steps to create an account by
authenticating with GitHub, and to authorize another app to connect to
your account chain.
