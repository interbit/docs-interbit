= Platform Operation

This section describes how to use the Accounts and Template apps,
demonstrating how to use GitHub as an identity provider to create your
own blockchain-based account, and how to authorize access from another
app.

NOTE: The following procedure assumes that you have performed the steps
described in the link:configure.adoc[Configure the Example] and
link:run.adoc[Run the Example Locally] sections.


== Create an account via GitHub OAuth

. Open the browser tab displaying the Accounts app.
+
The URL for the Accounts app is `http://localhost:3025`.
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app.png["The Accounts app", 1280, 541,
role="frame"]

. Open the browser's developer tools and select the console tab.
+
Verify that you see the `interbit-middleware/CHAIN_BLOCKING` status
logged to the console for the `accountsPrivate` chain.
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app-console.png["The Accounts app with the
browser's developer console open", 1280, 676, role="frame"]
+
NOTE: If you do not see `interbit-middleware/CHAIN_BLOCKING`, but you do
see `interbit-middleware: reducer() Object`, reload the page.
+
The Interbit middleware prints a number of messages to the console so
that you can see, for instance, when chains have loaded and actions have
been dispatched. The Accounts app is fully up and running when you see
the above message. At this point, you can dispatch actions to your
`accountsPrivate` chain.

. Navigate to the `create-account` page by clicking on the **Create
  Account / Sign in** link in the page header. The **Create account**
  screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app-create.png["The Create account screen in
the Accounts app", 1280, 601, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-create_account.png["The Create Account button", 195,
  48, role="right"]
  Click the **Create Account** button. A dialog appears with a
  disclaimer, asking you to confirm that you're aware that the Interbit
  platform is experimental:
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app-test_dialog.png["The Interbit dialog",
1280, 634, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-continue.png["The Create Account button", 147,
  48, role="right"]
  Check the **I acknowledge that I have read and understood this
  disclaimer** checkbox, then click the **Continue** button. The
  GitHub authorization screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-github-authorize.png["The GitHub authorization screen",
1280, 639, role="frame"]
+
NOTE: If you are not already signed in to your GitHub account, you would
see a GitHub login screen first.

. image:img/button-github-authorize.png["The GitHub Authorize button",
  448, 34, role="right"]
  Review the request for access, then click the **Authorize _username_**
  button. Once the authorization is complete, the **My Account** screen
  is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app-my_account.png["The My Account screen in
the Accounts app", 1280, 465, role="frame"]
+
When you see **Signed-in** at the right of the page header, you know
that authentication is successful.

Congratulations! You have created an Interbit account. You can make
changes to your personal account information and see how the new blocks
are added to your `accountsPrivate` chain with each change.


=== Additional verification steps

. Verify that your user account information is on the private chain.
  Navigate to the **Block Explorer** page and expand the `profile`
  object property in the `accountsPrivate` chain.
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app-be-ghi.png["The Block Explorer screen in
the Accounts app, showing the GitHub identity", 1280, 629, role="frame"]
+
If you have not made any changes to your user profile information, you
should see the that the `name` and `gitHub-identity` properties have
values and that your GitHub profile information is stored in
`gitHub-identity`.

. Verify that your user account information is not yet shared with any
  other apps by checking that the `shared` property in the
  `accountsPrivate` chain state is empty.
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app-be-shared.png["The Block Explorer screen
in the Accounts app, showing the shared status is empty", 1280, 629,
role="frame"]


== Allow the Template app to connect to your private account chain

Now that we have created a user account on the Accounts app, we can
authorize the `interbit-template` app to read your name and email from
your private accounts chain.

. Open the browser tab displaying the Template app.
+
The URL for the Template app is `http://localhost:3000`.
+
image:img/screen-template_app.png["The Template app", 1280, 703,
role="frame"]

. Open the browser's developer tools and select the console tab.
+
Verify that you see the `interbit-middleware/CHAIN_BLOCKING` status
logged to the console for the `templatePrivate` chain.
+
image:img/screen-template_app-console.png["The Template app with the
browser's developer console open", 1280, 675, role="frame"]
+
NOTE: If you do not see `interbit-middleware/CHAIN_BLOCKING`, but you do
see `interbit-middleware: reducer() Object`, reload the page.

. Verify that no data is shared on the `templatePrivate` chain.
+
Navigate to the **Block Explorer** page and check that the
`sharedProfile` property in the `templatePrivate` chain state is empty.
+
image:img/screen-template_app-be.png["The Block Explorer screen in the
Template app, showing that no data is shared", 1280, 659, role="frame"]

. Click the **Connect to Profile** link in the header to navigate to the
  `/cauth/request` page.
+
image:img/screen-template_app-connect.png["The Start the cAuth loop page
in the Template app", 1280, 224, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-request_cauth.png["The Request cAuth button", 116,
  34, role="right"]
  Click the **Request cAuth** button on the `/cauth/request` page.
+
**At this point, you are redirected to the Accounts app.**
+
The Accounts app's authorization screen is displayed:
+
image:img/screen-accounts_app-authorize.png["The authorization screen in
the Accounts app", 1280, 710, role="frame"]
+
The `templatePrivate` chain is requesting a read join with the
`accountsPrivate` chain for the `name` and `email` profile fields. Joins
can be configured so that only specific fields are shared. Since the
`email` field does not yet exist, you are given the opportunity to
create and populate the field.

. Click the **Add email** link, enter an email address, then click the
**Save** button.
+
image:img/form-accounts_app-email.png["The email form in the Accounts
app", 645, 377, role="frame"]
+
The authorization screen updates, and the **Accept** button becomes
active:
+
image:img/form-accounts_app-filled.png["The authorization form in the
Accounts app", 645, 279, role="frame"]
+
Using the browser's developer console, you can verify that the
`accountsPrivate` chain has a new block, and that the email address has
been added to the profile.


. [[step_authorize]]image:img/button-accept.png["The Accept button", 133,
  48, role="right"]
  Authorize the request for information by clicking the **Accept**
  button.
+
**At this point, you are redirected to the Template app.**
+
In the Template app and should see a message stating `Complete the cAuth
loop` with a profile identifier of the form `PROFILE-****`.
+
image:img/screen-template_app-complete_cauth.png["The Complete the cAuth
loop screen in the Template app", 1280, 268, role="frame"]

. image:img/button-complete_cauth.png["The Complete cAuth button", 126,
  34, role="right"]
  Complete the chain authorization flow by clicking the **Complete
  cAuth** button.
+
The button click dispatches an action to the `templatePrivate` chain and
updates the state with the shared profile information.


=== Additional verification steps

. Verify that the `templatePrivate` chain state has the newly-shared
profile information. Navigate to the **Block Explorer** and expand the
`sharedProfile` property.
+
image:img/screen-template_app-be-shared.png["The Block Explorer screen
in the Template app, showing that the profile is now shared", 1280,
659, role="frame"]
+
The `name` and `email` fields are populated with the values entered from
the Accounts app.
+
The `accountsPrivate` and `templatePrivate` chains are now joined.
Whenever any updates to the user's name or email occur in the Accounts
app, these changes are automatically reflected in the `templatePrivate`
chain.

. Verify that the chain join on the `accountsPrivate` chain. From the
  **Block Explorer** in the Accounts app, expand the `shared` property
  and check that there is an entry with the same profile identifier as
  in <<step_authorize,the authorization step>>.
+

Explorer screen in the Accounts app, showing the shared profile now
contains populated data", 1280, 581, role="frame"]


== Example complete

Congratulations! You have successfully completed this example. To recap,
the example has demonstrated:

- the structure of coordinated Interbit nodes and apps,
- configuration of nodes and apps,
- how to start nodes and apps,
- how those coordinated nodes and apps work in practice.

Now that you have a working example, you have a foundation to tinker and
learn further.
