= `destroyChain(chainId)`

Removes chain related resources from all hypervisors that host the
chain, except if other chains have a join with the deleted chain; their
join config is not cleaned up automatically.

NOTE: Any chain-related data in the KV store does not get deleted
currently.

This function dispatches a
link:../../interbit-covenant-utils/destroy.adoc[destroy] action into the
hypervisor for the specified chain ID. This action can also be
dispatched from user covenants.


== Arguments

1. `chainId` *(String)*: The chain ID of the chain to destroy


== Returns

*(bool)*: Whether or not the chain was successfully destroyed.
