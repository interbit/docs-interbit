= The `covenant` configuration object

The `covenant` configuration object appears within an
link:README.adoc[Interbit configuration file]. It describes the
location in the filesystem where the covenant's code can be found. The
covenant is packed into a binary file and is deployed to specific
blockchains so that all nodes can process the covenant.

The filesystem path to the covenant's NPM package directory.

The covenant must be NPM packable from an external location due to
the distribution of covenants across the network. This means no
external, local, file references.
