= The `covenant` configuration object

The `covenant` configuration object appears within an
link:README.adoc[Interbit configuration file]. It describes the
location in the filesystem where the covenant's NPM package code can be
found. The covenant cab be packed into a binary file and deployed to
specific blockchains (based on configuration) so that nodes can apply
the covenant.

the distribution of covenants across the network. This means no
external, local, file references.
