= The `app` resolution object

The `app` resolution object appears within an link:README.adoc[Interbit
manifest file]. It describes the resolved configuration for an Interbit
application, describing which blockchain should load the application,
the filesystem path to the built application, and the blockchains that
the browser nodes should load.

with `id="interbit"`).
