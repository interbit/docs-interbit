= `create`

An Interbit CLI command that creates a new Interbit application with a
connected React front-end application.


== Syntax

[listing,subs="quotes"]
interbit **create** --name _app-name_


== Options

[horizontal]
[.api.p]`--name` [.api.t]__String__ [.api.r]**Required**::
Specifies the name of the application, and the name of the directory
that is created to hold all of the code and assets for the application.


== Discussion

The application is created in a directory based on the `--name`
provided. The new application comes with scripts to interact with the
React app and the Interbit application. It is ready to go with Node.js
modules already installed.

To start the Interbit node, open a terminal window and run the following
commands:

[listing,subs="quotes"]
cd _app-name_
npm run interbit:start

To start the React app (the web interface), open another terminal window
and run the following commands:

[listing,subs="quotes"]
cd _app-name_
npm start
