= Configuration and Manifest File

Interbit uses a
link:/reference/interbit-cli/config/README.adoc[configuration] file so
that you can describe your entire blockchain network in a single place.
This file allows you to generate and manage networks based on the
constraints described in the configuration.

The link:/reference/interbit-cli/manifest/README.adoc[manifest] file is
generated during the link:/reference/interbit-cli/build.adoc[`interbit
build`] step to describe a fully resolved and deployable blockchain
network.
